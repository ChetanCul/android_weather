# Android Weather

Retrieving data from OpenWeatherMap API. 

To use it is necessary to provide a valid API key. In `resources -> values` create an xml file called `api.xml` with the following structure: 
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="appid">Insert here your API key</string>
</resources>
```
and insert your API key as value of the `appid` string.
