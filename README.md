# Android Weather

Personal project started after graduating from the Android Basics Nanodegree at Udacity.com. 
This is a project I use to practice my android development skills with the aim to try new libraries, architechture patterns and design ideas. 

To see the evolution of the app, take a look to the <a href="https://github.com/laramartin/android_weather/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md" target="_blank">CHANGELOG.md</a>


## To use it

- Retrieving data from OpenWeatherMap API. 

- To use it is necessary to store locally an environment variable with valid API key. Set a new environment variable in your computer with variable name `API_KEY` and value `"your_api_key"`.
